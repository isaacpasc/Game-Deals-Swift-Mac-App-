This is a very useful Mac program that shows you the best deals on games at any online retailer.
As the program is started, the public api gameshark is loaded in to a tableview.
You are then allowed to filter by title, stores, or price.
You are also able to sort by best deal, title, saving(%), price, recent, or release date.
The stores Shown drop down is dynamically generated based on what stores are available on gameshark at the moment.
When a game is selected in the tableview, a picture is shown of the title in the bottom corner(if available)
And a metacritic link is shown to take you to a rating of the selected game.
